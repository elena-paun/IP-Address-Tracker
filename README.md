## [IP-Address-Tracker APP](https://ip-address-tracker-sigma.vercel.app/)

## The challenge
 This challenge consisted in building an IP Address Tracker App and getting it to look as close to the design offered by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). To get the IP Address Locations, I used the [IP Geolocation API by Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org/) and [IP Geolocation API](https://ipgeolocation.io/). To generate the map, I used the [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).
